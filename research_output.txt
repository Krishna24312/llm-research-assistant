Apples generally last about 1 to 2 weeks in the refrigerator when stored properly. Signs of spoilage include discoloration, soft texture, and bruises. To maximize their shelf life, store them at a temperature around 30 to 35 degrees Fahrenheit. If an apple is bruised or spoiled, it is recommended to consume it quickly or remove it from the batch, as it can cause the remaining apples to rot.
